# Programming habits

Some tips and approaches for programmers that I noticed and personally found useful:
- Working from office helps be more efficient and keep work-life balance.
- Refactoring helps fix a bug.
- Writing documentation helps better understand what you've done, 
  structurise gained knowledge and release memory.<br>
  Once important details are covered, you can forget about it and easily switch to the next task.
