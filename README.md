# About

Having **Java** as a primary skill, I‘ve been doing commercial development for **5 years** so far.
Working on Backend, REST API, Frontend, Cloud, Desktop **apps**,
I‘ve got experience with such **skills** as Java 8, JavaEE, Spring, AWS, SQL, JavaFX, Git, Scrum, Windows.

I've come across different **stages of development** such as Research, Software Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment. 
In addition to development itself, I had wide range of **responsibilities**: 
from Requirements Clarification to Product Release.

Thanks to fluent **English** and good soft skills, I‘m an efficient **Team Player** even in case of international teams. 
In fact, I’ve been communicating with foreign colleagues and stakeholders for more than **2 years** already.

I consider myself as a responsible person and also take care about others.
I have production experience of **Team Leading** and was a Mentor for education programs.
Personally, I'm happy to share experience and help others. Colleagues often ask me for advice.

I'm always open to **feedback** about my work. 
On each project, my professional and personal qualities met or even exceeded expectations.
At the same time, I see the ways for self-improvement and continue working on my hard, soft, and leadership skills. 

In the **future** I plan to take Lead Software Engineer position
