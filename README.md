# Software Engineer Portfolio
Welcome to Senior Software Engineer's page!

## About me

Having **Java** as a primary skill, I‘ve been doing commercial development for **5 years** so far.
Working on **Backend**, **REST API**, **Frontend**, **Cloud** apps, 
I‘ve got experience with **Java 8**, **JavaEE**, **Spring**, **AWS**, **SQL**, **Git**, **Scrum**, **Windows**.

I've come across different stages of development such as **Research**, **Software Design**, **Development**, **Testing**, **Deployment**. 
In addition to development itself, I had wide range of responsibilities: 
from **Requirements Clarification** to **Product Release**.

Thanks to fluent **English** and good soft skills, I‘m an efficient **Team Player** even in case of international teams. 
In fact, I’ve been communicating with **foreign** colleagues and stakeholders for more than **2 years** already.

I consider myself as a responsible person and also take care about others.
I have production experience of **Team Leading**  and was a **Mentor** for education programs.
Personally, I'm happy to **share** experience and **help** others. Colleagues often ask me for advice.

I'm always open to **feedback** about my work. 
On each project, my professional and personal qualities met or even exceeded expectations.
At the same time, I see the ways for self-improvement and continue working on my hard, soft, and leadership skills. 
In the future, I plan to take Lead Software Engineer position
