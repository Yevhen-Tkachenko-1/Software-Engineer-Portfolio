# About

![picture](resources/pictures/memes/Meme-Software-Engineer.PNG)

Having **Java** as a primary skill, I've been doing commercial development for **5.5 years** so far.
During this time I've come across different apps such as _Backend_, _REST API_, _Cloud_, _Frontend_, _Desktop_.
Working on these apps, I've got considerable experience with _Java 8_, _JavaEE_, _Spring_, _AWS_, _SQL_, _NoSQL_, _JavaFX_, _Git_, _Windows_.

Regarding **responsibilities**, I'm familiar with all the main stages of engineering.
Working on _Technical Research_, _Software Design_, _Implementation_, _Testing_, _Deployment_,
I showed quite efficient work on the _Full Cycle_ development.
**Achievements** are 3 apps implemented from _scratch_ and with 3 others I worked on _extension_.

Thanks to fluent **English** and good soft skills, I'm an efficient **Team Player** even in case of international teams.
In fact, I've been communicating with foreign colleagues and stakeholders for more than 2 years already.
I consider myself as a responsible person and also can take care about others. 
I have production experience of _Team Leading_ and was a _Mentor_ for education programs.
In addition to team membership, I have more than 2 years of independent work as a **Key Developer**.

I'm always open to **Feedback** about my work. 
On each project, my professional and personal qualities met or even exceeded expectations.
At the same time, I see the ways for self-improvement and continue working on my _hard_, _soft_, and _leadership_ skills.
Currently, I'm recognized as a _Senior_ and for the future I plan to take _Lead Software Engineer_ position.

# Project Changing

![picture](resources/pictures/memes/Meme-Handshake.PNG)

My thoughts on changing the project: 
- When is the right time to look for new opportunities?
- What to check to find the best fit?

Personally, I really like stable companies and projects where I can work for a long period, e.g. 2 years and more.
Long term assignment is profitable for both: developer and company.
For example, working on large enterprise apps, first you have to spend some time and resources to get to know the project.
It's kinda an investment that later brings benefits such as satisfaction from your work, 
possibilities to make bigger impact and finally, bringing more value to the project.
Even when building large app from scratch, you need to define the architecture and establish the development processes 
that is also beneficial only in long term run.

Such commitment also has other side.
That's great if you are always excited about work you do.
However, at some projects, at some point (for example in 2 years of development),
you may find yourself doing the same job day-to-day with no opportunity to grow.
In case this can't be changed due to project limitations I would consider to switch to another project.

I realize importance and risks of such decision for myself, my current project and future project.
In such cases, first of all, I talk about my concerns with project managers.
If we can't find solution, there are many other projects to join.
I try to find the best fit and finally accept the offer very carefully.
Joining new project is weighted decision that means I commit for long term cooperation.

So, I have some points to check when applying for new projects:

- Why is position open?
- Project Domain: what is it about? what is outcome? which impact does it make?
- Tech Stack, e.g. key language, frameworks, versions, databases.
- Development Type, e.g. full cycle, support, migration.
- Development Responsibilities, e.g. design, research, implementation, delivery.
- What do regular tasks look like? Any specific work scope for newcomer? Any specific release dates? Any urgent deadlines?
- Development Methodology, e.g. Scrum. Any specific processes? How many regular meetings?
- How is the task formulated? How developer is involved in requirements clarification, testing and deployment?
- Project Team, e.g. size, kinds of specialists, presents of local and foreign colleagues.
- Interaction with customers and English-speaking colleagues.
- Is work laptop provided? Which OS, e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac.
- Project Tools, e.g. IDE, VCS, apps for chatting, online meetings, task tracking.
- Are there less experienced colleagues to play mentor role?
- Are there more experienced colleagues to ask for help?
- Work hours (time zone dependencies).
- General work tempo: Any constant pressure to be fast? Any lack of tasks or presence of complex processes, so it gets slow?
- Is there overtime work? If so, is it compensated?
- Is there activity tracker, e.g. mouse movement tracking, screen capture?
- Onboarding: Are there any flow and materials to help newcomer understand project? How much time allocated?
- Probation period: Is it present? How long does it take? In which period is it expected for newcomer to get started with regular pace?
- Project Stability: Will there be work in 1 year?
- Project Perspectives: Is there space to grow and take more complex tasks and next level responsibilities?
- Office, its location, workplace and benefits.
- Non-project activities, e.g. team-buildings, events, conferences, hackathons.
- Education support, sport compensation, health insurance.
- Are there any business trip? (especially interesting if it helps you meet your implementation in real life)
- Additional bonuses for good performance, successfully released features, resolving additional tasks asked by customer, providing better solution. 
- Compensation Range for the position.
- Compensation Review: What to do to get it? How often? Regular or by asking? Which amount is it possible to have in 2 years?

# Programming Habits

Some tips and approaches for programmers that I noticed and personally found useful:

- Work from office helps be more efficient and keep work-life balance.
  Also, it's more secure and company is less concerned about employee's doings.
- Refactoring helps fix bugs.
  For example, in `Java` it's nice to use `Stream API`, but sometimes it's overcomplicated.
  When we have many invocations in a row, such code is not possible to understand.
  I would rather have plain Java implementation then complex constructions.
  This way, refactoring helped me several times to find an issue.
- Writing documentation helps better understand what you've done,
  structurise gained knowledge and release memory.
  Once important details are covered, you can forget about it and easily switch to the next task.
- Adjusting the video playback speed helps learn quickly.
  I like watching tutorials, but sometimes it's very detailed and takes much time.
  Advice is quite simple but helped me a lot.
  Most recordings have good quality, so it's possible to speed up playback to 1.5 without losing understanding.
  With this my learning becomes faster and as a result, I feel comfortable to continue learning this way.
